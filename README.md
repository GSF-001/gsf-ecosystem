### GSF — Global System Framework

![mystery](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bebafcd-b0c6-4d5f-beb5-0b25fea2bff2)

A self-sustaining system for **coordination, reputation, and automated incentives**.  
No custody. No financial advice. No central control.

> Designed to remain operational even if its original authors disappear.

### What is GSF?

GSF is **not a product**. It is a **system architecture** coordinating:

- identity  
- reputation  
- incentives  
- governance  
- automation  

Money moves only through external brokers; GSF moves **signals and rules**.

### Architecture Layers

- **User Interface**  
- **Coordination Layer (Governance API)**  
- **Reputation & Feedback Engine**  
- **Automation Layer (Cron / Workers / Ledger)**  
- **External Brokers (No custody)**

> Each layer is modular and replaceable. The system continues running even if operators disappear.
