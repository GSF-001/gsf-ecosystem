# NON-GOALS

This document defines what GSF is explicitly NOT designed to do.

GSF is not a product.
GSF is not a platform.
GSF is not a financial service.

## GSF does NOT:

- Custody user funds
- Execute trades or investments
- Provide financial advice
- Guarantee profit or outcomes
- Act as a broker, exchange, or wallet
- Enforce off-chain behavior
- Moderate communities manually
- Replace legal, regulatory, or human accountability
- Optimize for growth, hype, or mass adoption

## Explicit exclusions

- No user KYC
- No asset management
- No promises of returns
- No centralized control plane
- No manual intervention loops

If any of the above are required,
GSF is the wrong system.

Silence, boundaries, and failure visibility
are intentional design choices.
