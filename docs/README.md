# GSF – Global Snowball Framework (Open Blueprint)

GSF is an open system blueprint for building a modular coordination ecosystem that combines:

- Education & community (Mentors / IB / VIP Rooms)
- Governance & treasury coordination (multisig logic, circuit breakers, rolling keys)
- Modular infrastructure (broker integration, property, healthcare, R&D, etc.)
- Security-first design (HSM, pause/resume, forensics, audit logs)

This repository is NOT a finished product.  
It is an **open blueprint** meant to be challenged, reviewed, and improved collaboratively.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Stress-test GSF ideas technically and conceptually  
- Turn abstract vision into implementable system design  
- Invite collaboration on:
  - System architecture
  - Security models
  - Governance & legal framing
  - Protocol-level designs

---

## 🤝 Who Should Contribute?
- Backend / infrastructure engineers  
- Security engineers  
- Blockchain / distributed systems engineers  
- Product / system designers  
- Legal / governance thinkers  

You don’t need to be a great coder.  
If you can think in systems, you’re welcome.
