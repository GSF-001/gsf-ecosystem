Real talk (straight, no bullshit)
Right now your repo is not “dead” —
it’s just missing entry points for humans.
People don’t collaborate because: ❌ no clear starting task
❌ no clear role
❌ no clear problem to solve
With:
README (vision)
TASKS (entry points)
CONTRIBUTING (rules)
your repo becomes a playground for system thinkers —
not just another GitHub graveyard.
