# GSF – Global Snowball Framework (Open Blueprint)

GSF is an open system blueprint for building a modular ecosystem that combines:
- Education & community (Mentors / IB / VIP Rooms)
- Governance & treasury (multisig, circuit breakers, rolling keys)
- Modular infrastructure (broker integration, property, healthcare, R&D, etc.)
- Security-first design (HSM, pause/resume, forensics, audit logs)

This repository is NOT a finished product.
It is an **open blueprint** meant to be challenged, reviewed, and improved collaboratively.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
- Stress-test the GSF ideas technically and conceptually  
- Turn abstract vision into implementable system design  
- Invite collaboration on:
  - System architecture  
  - Security models  
  - Governance & legal framing  
  - Prototype-level designs
