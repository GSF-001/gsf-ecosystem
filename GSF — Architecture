GSF is built as a layered coordination system.

The platform does not hold user funds.  
All financial actions are executed by external brokers.  
GSF only coordinates identity, reputation, rules, and incentives.

## Layers

### 1. Interface Layer
- Web / PWA client  
- Displays rooms, reputation, events, feedback, status  
- No financial logic  

### 2. Coordination Layer
- Governance API  
- Role & permission logic  
- Policy routing (who can do what)  

### 3. Reputation & Feedback
- Non-financial scoring  
- Behavior tracking  
- Pattern detection (toxic / misleading behavior)  
- Visibility weighting  

### 4. Automation Layer
- Scheduled jobs (cron)  
- Event triggers  
- Reward distribution  
- Audit logging  

### 5. External Execution
- Brokers execute trades  
- Payment processors execute transfers  
- GSF never touches funds

## Design Principles

- Replaceable modules  
- Minimal trust in operators  
- Deterministic system rules  
- Observable system state  
- No hidden financial flows  

---

## Failure Model

GSF assumes:

- mentors can lie  
- users can behave badly  
- operators can disappear  

The system must continue functioning even when humans fail.

---

## Non-Goals

- No custody of funds  
- No financial advice  
- No profit guarantees  
- No centralized moderation dependency

## Status

Architecture reference only.  
Implementation may differ.
